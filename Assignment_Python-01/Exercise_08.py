''' Write a function that takes a number 1 to 9 from the user input (use input function inside
 a function). Store a number in a variable (letâ€™s assume 6). If the input value is less than
 the variable, print (your guess is almost there), if the input value is greater than the
 variable, print- your guess is higher, if the input value and variable are equals, print
Your Guess Is Correct!'''
