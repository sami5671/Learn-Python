`NOTE: Tuple data type is immutable & its a ordered data type`

### Declaring and Accessing Data 

```Python
# Declaring tuple data
x = (10, 20, 30)

print(x[1]) # will print 10

print(x[-1]) # will print the last element

print(x) # will print all tuple element


# Ordered data type
x = (10,20,30)

print(x)

## tuple' object does not support item assignment
# x[1] = 10  
```
